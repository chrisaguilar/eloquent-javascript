/*
When we looked up all the people in our data set that lived more than
90 years, only the latest generation in the data came out. Letâ€™s take a closer
look at that phenomenon.
Compute and output the average age of the people in the ancestry
data set per century. A person is assigned to a century by taking their year
of death, dividing it by 100, and rounding it up, as in Math.ceil(person.died /
100) .
For bonus points, write a function groupBy that abstracts the grouping
operation. It should accept as arguments an array and a function that com-
putes the group for an element in the array and returns an object that maps
group names to arrays of group numbers.

const ancestry = JSON.parse(require('./ancestry'));

const average = arr => arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / arr.length;

const groupBy = (arr, fn) => {
  let groups = {};
  arr.forEach(val => 
    fn(val) in groups ?
      groups[fn(val)].push(val)
      :groups[fn(val)] = [val]
  );
  return groups;
}

const centuries = groupBy(ancestry, person => Math.ceil(person.died / 100));

for(let century in centuries) {
  const ages = centuries[century].map(person => person.died - person.born);
  console.log(`${century}: ${average(ages)}`);
}
